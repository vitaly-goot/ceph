// reads at any time, an incomplete one when it is old enough or when the log
// must reclaim its oldest segment.

// Each segment occupies one of max_segments fixed slot objects. A record is
// placed once (slot, offset) and the caller writes the same bytes into every
// holder shard's copy of that slot (emit), so all copies are identical and a
// replaying primary can read any of them. A segment's slot is reused as soon
